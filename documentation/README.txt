NOAH'S ARK GAME - README.txt
------------------------------
This file contains basic information on the Noah's Ark game.
This game aims to provide a fun way to explore the Biblical story of Noah's Ark.

THIS GAME IS NOT RATED BY THE ESRB OR OTHER VIDEO GAME RATINGS BOARD.
In order to explore the Biblical account of Noah's Ark as faithfully as possible in the medium of this game,
the game uses exact Bible verses (from the public domain KJV - King James Version - translation).

The game itself and its source code are released into the public domain and free to distribute/modify without restriction,
but certain third-party resources used in the game have slightly more restrictive licenses, so consult associated license
files distributed with this game for more information.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------
The game is designed to run on Windows 10 (or greater) computer systems with x64 CPUs.
It may run on other Windows operating systems with x64 CPUs, but that has not been tested.

The game is distributed as a ZIP file, so no complex installation process is required.
Just extract the contents of the ZIP file to a writable folder on your computer.
Less than 100 MB of disk space is required.

When running, the game may require up to 200 MB of RAM.  To ensure plenty of room for the game
and other programs running on your computer, at least 2-4 GB of RAM is recommended.

BUGS
------------------------------
The game is currently in a BETA phase, so the game is not necessarily feature-complete, 
and it is expected for there to be a lot of bugs.

You can report bugs (or any other feedback) to the primary developer (Jacob Pike) via
any means.  Email (jacob@jacobpike.com) or reporting issues on the GitHub issues page
(https://github.com/jpike/noah_ark/issues) are two such ways of reporting bugs/feedback.

When reporting bugs, any information you can provide (like exact error messages),
including information about your computer (specs like operating system, RAM, CPU)
are valuable.

BASIC GAMEPLAY & CONTROLS
------------------------------
This game is in many ways a very "traditional" video game, having gameplay take place
using a 2D overhead view on tile maps.

The gameplay follows the following basic sequence:
- Collecting wood, food, animals, and family members in the overworld.
- Spending time on the ark during the flood.
- A small bit of post-flood gameplay back on land.

Some smaller "cutscenes" exist to transition between the main gameplay states.

Controls come exclusively from the keyboard, with the following being the primary controls:
- Arrow keys - Movement in the game world, moving through menu options, moving through the inventory.
- Z - The primary "action" key (used for things like swinging the axe).
- X - Opens/closes the inventory.
- ESC (Escape) - Pause the game, allowing saving or returning to the title screen (it is important to use this to save your game).

A few other keys are occasionally used, with prompts appearing on-screen to indicate appropriate keys.
