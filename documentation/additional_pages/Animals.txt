@page animals Animals

One of the main quests of the game will involve collecting animals, based on the following Bible verses:

> And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
> Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
- *Genesis 6:19-20*

> Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.
> Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
- *Genesis 7:2-3*

@section initial_animals Initial Animals

To keep things in scope, only a small set of animals will be implemented at first.  The animals initially chosen were based on explicit early Biblical references (including in the story of Noah) and to give variety for the different "categories" of creatures described in the versus above.

Animals are classified as clean/unclean soley for the purposes of accurately representing the commands given above.  7 pairs of each clean animal will be gathered, but only 1 pair of each unclean animal will be gathered.  See [Acts 10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+10) and [Romans 14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans++14) for just a small sample of discussion of clean/unclean food in the New Testament.  If you find inaccuracy in the classification of animals below, let me know.

The following batch of 7 animals will be implemented initially:

Animal | Bible Reference | Clean?
------ | --------------- | ------
Raven  | [Genesis 8:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+8:7&version=KJV) | No [Leviticus 11:13-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+11%3A13-15&version=KJV)
Dove   | [Genesis 8:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+8:8&version=KJV) | Yes [Genesis 15:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+15:9&version=KJV)
Sheep  | [Genesis 4:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+4:2&version=KJV) | Yes [Deuteronomy 14:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+14:4&version=KJV)
Cattle | [Genesis 1:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1:24&version=KJV) | Yes [Deuteronomy 14:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+14:4&version=KJV)
Camel  | [Genesis 12:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+12:16&version=KJV) | No [Leviticus 11:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+11%3A4&version=KJV)
Frog   | [Exodus 8:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+8%3A2&version=KJV) | No [Leviticus 11:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+11%3A9-10&version=KJV)
Locust | [Exodus 10:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+10%3A4&version=KJV) | Yes [Leviticus 11:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+11:22&version=KJV)

@section animal_graphics Animal Graphics

Each animal is expected to have 2 frames of animation that will be played continuously when the animal is on-screen.  For the initial batch of animals, each frame should be 16 x 16 pixels, but larger animal sprites may come in the future.

Since both male and female animals need to be collected, each species of animal should have separate sprite representations.  For many types of animals, the differences in the sprite graphics can be minor.  However, greater differences may be appropriate for animals with distinct male/female names (ex. cow/bull for cattle).

@section animal_sounds Animal Sounds

Each animal should have an appropriate and short sound effect to be played at random when the animal is on-screen.

@section animal_behavior Animal Behavior

It would be nice to have unique kinds of animal behavior or ways to collect the animals.  If you have any ideas, let me know.  I'm pretty open, but things shouldn't be too difficult (since the animals are described as coming to Noah in Genesis 6:20).
