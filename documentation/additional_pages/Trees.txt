> Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
- *Genesis 6:14*

To build the ark, Noah obviously needs to gather wood.  The Bible specifies [gopher wood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_wood), but there is debate over exactly what type of wood this is.  Favored ideas seem to be cypress or cedar, but those are still not definite.

Initially, trees will only be implemented for gathering wood, but different types of trees may be added in the future for other reasons (like food).

Trees in Nintendo's Animal Crossing games may be good references.

@section tree_behavior Tree Behavior

In the game, Noah will chop down trees with an axe to gather wood.  When Noah swings his axe and hits a tree, the tree should briefly shake.  After about 3 hits (exact number may be adjusted) with an axe, the tree should become wood.  This is illustrated in the sequence of images below:

 _ | _ | _ | _
 - | - | - | -
@image html axe_swing/axe_swing1.jpg "" | @image html axe_swing/axe_swing2.jpg "" | @image html axe_swing/axe_swing3.jpg "" | @image html axe_swing/axe_swing4.jpg ""
Repeat previous 4 steps two more times. | @image html axe_swing/axe_swing6.jpg "" | @image html axe_swing/axe_swing7.jpg "" | Done.  Noah can now collect wood.

@section tree_graphics Tree Graphics

The overall size of the trees is to-be-determined.  The minimum size (width x height) is 16x16 pixels, but 32x32 or 16x32 may work as well.

The tree needs at least 2 frames of animation so that it can shake when it.  More frames can be added if they would result in a better animation.

It may be fine to have the "top" and "bottom" of the tree be separate components for the purposes of achieving the desired animation.  For example, a single "bottom" for the trunk may work, with the "top" green area just shifting back-and-forth.

The exact type of tree depicted in the game isn't too important, but it should have some kind of greenery on it.  If a specific "reference" tree is preferred, cypress or cedar could be used (see above), but a generic tree will work.  The most important thing is that it is clearly recognizable as a tree.

Finally, a generic wood/log sprite (single frame, 16x16) is needed for after a tree is cut down.  As an added effect, some kind of dust/smoke effect could be added for the transistion of tree to wood, but this is optional.

@section tree_sound Tree Sounds

A brief sound effect is needed for when the tree is shaking after being hit with an axe.  A "rustling of leaves" sound or a tree hitting the ground may be appropriate.
